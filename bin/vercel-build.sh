# Vercel Build Pipeline
#
# Full build pipeline for Vercel deployments:
#   1. Build plugin UMD bundles (source-hash cache skips unchanged)
#   2. Copy bundles to public/cdn/plugins/ for static serving
#   3. Push schema to database (skip generate — postinstall already did it)
#   4. Build the Next.js app
#   5. Sync plugin records in the database
#
# Optimizations:
#   - Source-hash caching skips unchanged plugins (build-plugins.sh)
#   - prisma db push and sync-plugin-registry always run (idempotent, ~5s + ~2s)
#
# Usage: ./bin/vercel-build.sh
#

# schema changes were many commits back (DIFF_BASE only checks recent commits).

# Step 5: Sync plugin registry in database
# Always run — it's idempotent (upserts) and fast (~2-3s).
# This ensures stale plugins are cleaned up when plugins are removed,
# and new plugins are registered even if only the sync script changed.
